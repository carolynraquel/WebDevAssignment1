Frontend Web Development Assignment 1: Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) <br>
Hi there, my name is Carolyn, and the files in this repo are for my first assignment in Fall 2024 Front-End Web Development (ITMD-443-543-01/02/03) taught by Raj Krishnan at Illinois Institute of Technology. </br>
At this point in my academic career, I still feel like a noob when it comes to coding and web hosting, though I have built some sophisticated automation programs on my own.  Code that even my professors had no idea how to approach.
Imposter syndrome is indeed a b****.
Fret not dear reader! If you got this far, you got a long way to go, and I'm right there with ya.
<br> I hope seeing this assignment helps you in your studies ðŸ“š </br>
